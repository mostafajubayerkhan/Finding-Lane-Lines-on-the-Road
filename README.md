# Finding-Lane-Lines-on-the-Road
*** In this project, I will use the tools I learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  I can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip "raw-lines-example.mp4" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below.   Once I have a result that looks roughly like "raw-lines-example.mp4", we'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments I've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result I am going for in the video "P1_example.mp4".  Ultimately, I would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.  --- Let's have a look at our first image called 'test_images/solidWhiteRight.jpg'.  Run the 2 cells below (hit Shift-Enter or the "play" button above) to display the image.  **Note** If, at any point, I encounter frozen display windows or other confounding issues, I can always start again with a clean slate by going to the "Kernel" menu above and selecting "Restart &amp; Clear Output".  ---
