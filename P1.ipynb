Where will your current algorithm be likely to fail?\n","\n","Please add your thoughts below,  and if you're up for making your pipeline more robust, be sure to scroll down and check out the optional challenge video below!\n","\n","**Jeremy's reflections**: This process is far simpler than I had imagined it would be before starting this project. I would even go so far as to say that, with the exception of the parameters for the Hough lines, the process is *extremely* simple. The majority of my time, before reaching the optional challenge, was spent tuning the Hough parameters (which makes sense, since it has so many paramaters it's bound to take some time to tune them), and then consolidating and extrapolating the Hough lines. \n","\n","A few things that I had considered to make my algorithm better:\n","1. Smoothing the jittery motion of the lines in the video: I had seen that someone implemented basically what I had envisioned (a global variable containing the previous lines, from which new lines are allowed to deviate only slightly), but I chose not to. Even though it would look nicer, I felt that it would, in a way, violate the spirit of the problem by masking away significantly deviated lane lines in some video frames.\n","2. During consolidation and extrapolation, weight the collection of Hough lines by their maximum Y position in the frame - thus giving more weight to lines at the bottom of the frame. As it is, my algorithm finds the lines with the maxiumum (left) and minimum (right, i.e. most negative) slopes, and averages all lines within a certain tolerance. This doesn't handle curved roads as well.\n","3. I did implement converting RGB to HSV, isolating the yellow channel, and boosting it in the grayscale image. This was necessary to get acceptable performance on the bridge section of the challenge video.\n","\n","My algorithm will surely fail in dark conditions and whenever there isn't sufficient contrast between the lane lines and the road. It will probably also have trouble on very curvy, uneven, or inclined surfaces.
